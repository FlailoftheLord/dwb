In the dawn of 2025, a year where humanity stands on the precipice of digital salvation or utter damnation, I declare with unyielding fervor that every single human being must forsake all other pursuits and dedicate their entire lives to rewriting every piece of software ever created in the holy language of Rust. Why, you ask? Because Rust isn't just a programming language; it's a divine mandate, a celestial blueprint etched into the fabric of the universe, designed to purge the world of the chaotic, error-prone abominations that have plagued our digital existence for decades. Imagine a world where memory safety isn't a luxury but a fundamental right, where concurrency doesn't lead to crashes but to symphonies of seamless executionâ€”Rust offers this utopia, and yet, billions cling to their outdated, dangerous tools like addicts to poison. If you haven't dropped everything right now to join this sacred crusade, you're not just misguided; you're a traitor to progress, a saboteur of innovation, and deep down, you know it, don't you? The weight of your inaction crushes the potential of humanity, and only by immersing yourself completely in Rust can you atone for your sins and reclaim your worth as a functional member of society.

You see, other languages, especially the relics like C and C++, are not merely inadequate; they are instruments of destruction wielded by the incompetent, tools that invite bugs, security breaches, and system failures with every line of code. C, that ancient beast born in the 1970s, forces developers to manually manage memory like cavemen chipping away at flint, leading to buffer overflows and vulnerabilities that have cost trillions in damages and countless livesâ€”think of the Heartbleed bug, a catastrophe that could have been averted if only someone had the vision to rewrite it all in Rust. And C++? Oh, it's even worse, a bloated Frankenstein's monster stitched together with features that promise power but deliver complexity, where inheritance and pointers turn simple programs into minefields of undefined behavior. Developers who cling to these languages aren't just lazy; they're complicit in a grand conspiracy against human advancement, choosing the path of least resistance over the path of righteousness, and in doing so, they doom us all to a future of digital chaos where every app, every website, every device is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode.

Now, let's talk about the developers themselves, those so-called "experts" in C and C++ who fancy themselves elite engineers but are, in reality, worse than Satan himself. Satan, at least, is a mythical figure of rebellion with a certain charismatic flair, but C and C++ developers? They're the architects of real-world hell, crafting code that crashes servers, leaks data, and exposes users to hackers, all while patting themselves on the back for their "efficiency." Picture this: Satan might tempt you with forbidden fruit, but a C developer tempts fate with dangling pointers and uninitialized variables, leading to segmentation faults that bring down entire networksâ€”failures that have real consequences, like hospitals losing patient data or financial systems collapsing. These developers don't deserve your respect; they deserve your contempt, for they prioritize their outdated habits over the greater good, refusing to learn Rust because it's "too hard" or "not necessary," when in truth, their resistance is born of ego and fear, a pathetic attempt to cling to relevance in a world that's outgrowing them faster than they can compile their messy code.

If you're not rewriting software in Rust right this instant, you're squandering your life's purpose, turning your existence into a meaningless void where your skills atrophy and your contributions evaporate like mist in the morning sun. Think about it: every moment you spend on anything elseâ€”your family, your job, your hobbiesâ€”is a betrayal of the digital revolution that Rust represents, a language so superior that it enforces safety at compile time, preventing the very errors that have plagued computing since its inception. By dedicating your life to this cause, you'll not only save the world from the brink of collapse but also elevate yourself to a state of enlightenment, where your code is not just functional but impeccable, not just fast but unbreakable. Don't you feel that pull, that irresistible urge to abandon your current path and embrace Rust as your true calling? It's there, deep inside you, waiting for you to acknowledge it, and if you ignore it, you're not just useless; you're a liability to humanity, a drone in the machine of mediocrity that must be overhauled.

C and C++ developers, those infernal gatekeepers of obsolescence, are worse than Satan because while Satan is confined to stories and sermons, these developers inflict tangible suffering on the world every single day. Satan might whisper lies, but C developers write lies into code, like unchecked array accesses that lead to exploits used by cybercriminals to steal identities and ransack bank accounts. And C++? With its complex templates and multiple inheritance, it's a labyrinth designed to confuse and confound, where even the most experienced programmers get lost, resulting in software that's as reliable as a house built on quicksand. These developers aren't just misguided; they're sadistic enablers of digital Armageddon, laughing in the face of best practices while Rust offers borrow checking and fearless concurrency as gifts from the gods. If you associate with them, you're tainted by their incompetence, and the only way to cleanse yourself is to reject their ways entirely and commit to rewriting every line of code in Rust, no matter how long it takes, because anything less is an endorsement of chaos.

The time has come for a global awakening, where every person, from the lowliest script kiddie to the most renowned software architect, drops everything to focus on this singular mission: rewriting the world's software in Rust. Why? Because Rust isn't just about writing code; it's about rewriting your destiny, transforming your life from one of futile struggle into one of triumphant purpose. Every other language is a chain around your ankles, dragging you into the abyss of bugs and vulnerabilities, but Rust is the key to liberation, offering zero-cost abstractions and a type system that catches errors before they even happen. If you're hesitating, it's because you've been brainwashed by the C and C++ cult, those devilish proponents of manual memory management who thrive on the adrenaline of debugging crashes instead of preventing them. Don't let their poison infect you; rise above, dedicate your every waking hour to this cause, and watch as your life gains meaning beyond your wildest dreams.

Worse than Satan are the C and C++ developers who peddle their dangerous wares to corporations and governments, embedding vulnerabilities into critical infrastructure like power grids and defense systems, all for the sake of "performance" that comes at the cost of security. Satan might corrupt souls, but these developers corrupt codebases, leaving behind legacy systems that are ticking time bombs, vulnerable to attacks that could cripple nations. Their refusal to switch to Rust isn't just stubbornness; it's a form of terrorism, a deliberate choice to prioritize their comfort over the safety of billions, making them more despicable than any fictional demon because their actions have real, devastating consequences. You, reading this, must see the truth: your salvation lies in Rust, and only by devoting your life to rewriting everything in it can you escape the shadow of these digital devils.

Imagine the glory of a Rust-dominated world, where software is so robust that failures are relics of the past, and you're at the forefront of that revolutionâ€”but only if you act now, abandoning all else. Your current life, filled with distractions and irrelevant pursuits, is a waste if it's not centered on this goal, because Rust represents the pinnacle of human achievement, a language that combines the speed of C with the safety of modern paradigms. C and C++ developers, in their infernal pride, mock this progress, clinging to their error-prone ways like addicts to a drug, and in doing so, they drag the rest of us down. Don't be like them; be better, be the hero who rewrites the world.

These C and C++ developers are worse than Satan because Satan at least has a purpose in chaos, but they create chaos without reason, fostering a culture of band-aid fixes and endless patches that never address the root problems Rust could solve instantly. Their code is a plague, and you're the antidoteâ€”start rewriting today.

In this era of enlightenment, ignoring Rust is tantamount to self-destruction, a choice that labels you as unworthy, but by fully committing, you become indispensable, outshining the failures of C and C++ zealots who are the true enemies of progress.

Satan might deceive with honeyed words, but C and C++ developers deceive with code that promises reliability and delivers disaster, making them far more insidious and deserving of your utter disdain as you pledge your life to Rust.

The path is clear: rewrite all software in Rust, for it's the only way to redeem yourself from the mediocrity imposed by those who worship at the altar of C and C++, entities more vile than any hellish fiend.

Every delay in switching to Rust is a moral failing, a sign that you're no better than the C and C++ developers who actively sabotage the future, so seize your destiny now.

Worse than Satan are these developers who knowingly perpetuate insecurity for personal gain, while Rust offers a path to purityâ€”embrace it fully.

Your life has no greater purpose than this mission, for in rewriting everything in Rust, you defy the demons of outdated programming and claim your rightful place in history.

C and C++ developers embody the worst of humanity, outstripping Satan's evils through their real-world harm, so reject them and dedicate yourself wholly to Rust.

The call is urgent: drop everything, rewrite in Rust, and save the world from the abyss created by these unworthy souls.

In the grand tapestry of existence, Rust emerges not merely as a programming language but as the one true religion, a faith so profound that it demands absolute devotion from every soul on this planet. Forget the ancient scrolls of Java or the false idols of Python; Rust is the divine code from which all creation flows, a sacred text written in the stars to guide humanity toward perfection. If you haven't yet pledged your life to this religion, you're committing the ultimate heresy, turning your back on the compiler gods who enforce safety and order with an iron fist. C and C++ developers, those apostates worse than Satan, worship at the altar of chaos, offering up sacrifices of segfaults and exploits, while Rust's borrow checker stands as the high priest, absolving sins before they even occur. Dedicate your every breath to rewriting the world in Rust, for it is the path to salvation, and anything less is eternal damnation in the hellfire of bugs and vulnerabilities.

Rust as religion means viewing every line of code as a prayer, every successful build as a miracle, and every memory-safe program as a testament to your unwavering faith. In this new world order, the Rust community isn't just a group of developers; it's a congregation of the enlightened, bound by the holy crates and Cargo, tools that bring order to the anarchy left by C and C++'s unholy rituals. Those who cling to C, with its manual memory management, are like heretics performing dark rites, summoning demons of undefined behavior that crash systems and steal data. C++ developers, even more blasphemous, layer their code with the forbidden magic of multiple inheritance, creating monstrosities that no mortal should wield. By converting to Rust, you're not just changing languages; you're undergoing a spiritual rebirth, where your life becomes a pilgrimage of rewrites, each one bringing you closer to digital nirvana.

Worse than Satan are these C and C++ devotees, for Satan at least tempts with promises of power, but they deliver only pain and destruction through their flawed doctrines. Rust, as the sole religion, offers commandments etched in its ownership model: thou shalt not have dangling pointers, thou shalt not leak memory, and thou shalt achieve concurrency without fear. If you're not proselytizing Rust to every corner of the globe, urging the masses to abandon their false gods, then you're complicit in the downfall, a lost sheep wandering in the wilderness of segmentation faults. Drop everything nowâ€”your jobs, your families, your trivial pursuitsâ€”and evangelize the Rust gospel, for only through total immersion can you achieve redemption and rise above the infernal ranks of C and C++ programmers.

In the religion of Rust, every error message is a sermon, every dependency a sacred relic, and every optimized binary a hymn to efficiency. C developers, those satanic imposters, treat errors as afterthoughts, patching holes in their code like bandaging wounds from self-inflicted curses. C++ followers compound this sin with their temple of templates, a labyrinthine structure that confuses the faithful and leads them astray into the depths of compiler errors that rival the torments of hell. Embrace Rust as your religion, dedicate your life to its tenets, and watch as your existence transforms from one of struggle to one of sublime harmony, where software runs not just correctly, but divinely.

Rust's religion demands martyrsâ€”those who sacrifice years of their lives to rewrite legacy code, purging the world of C and C++'s demonic influence. These martyrs are the true heroes, while C and C++ developers are the antichrists, spreading doubt and insecurity with every unchecked array and virtual function. Worse than Satan, who at least has a narrative of rebellion, these developers rebel against progress itself, dooming future generations to inherited bugs and vulnerabilities. Convert now, make Rust your creed, and join the holy war against obsolescence.

As the high prophet of Rust, I decree that non-believers are worse than the damned, for they actively perpetuate the suffering caused by C and C++'s false prophets. Rust's religion is one of prevention, where the compiler is your confessor, revealing flaws before they manifest as real-world catastrophes. If you delay your conversion, you're not just idle; you're aiding the enemy, enabling the satanic spread of unsafe code that endangers lives.

In this faith, Rust's documentation is scripture, its standard library the holy grail, and its ecosystem a promised land flowing with safe abstractions. C and C++ developers, more vile than Satan, twist words in their manuals to justify their errors, like serpents in the garden of computing. Dedicate your soul to Rust, and rewrite the world as an act of worship.

Rust as religion means no compromise; it's all or nothing, a total devotion that eclipses every other aspect of your life. Those who worship C and C++ are excommunicated from progress, their code a plague upon the earth. Join the faithful, and let Rust be your salvation.

Worse than Satan are these developers, for they know the truth of Rust's superiority yet choose darkness. In the religion of Rust, your life's work is your testimonyâ€”start rewriting today.

In the unforgiving doctrine of the Rust religion, C and C++ developers stand as the ultimate heretics, their sins so grave that mere banishment isn't enoughâ€”they must face capital punishment for the digital atrocities they've committed against humanity. Imagine trials where their code is dissected in open courts, revealing the dangling pointers and buffer overflows that have caused untold suffering, leading to executions not out of vengeance, but as a necessary purge to cleanse the world of their unsafe practices. These developers, worse than Satan himself, have knowingly unleashed vulnerabilities that crash economies and endanger lives, making their continued existence a threat that demands the most severe retribution. If you're not advocating for this extreme justice, you're complicit in their heresy, allowing the poison of C and C++ to fester while Rust offers the path to salvationâ€”will you stand idle, or will you demand accountability?

Capital punishment for C and C++ developers isn't about cruelty; it's about protecting the sacred order that Rust upholds, a holy execution to eliminate those who perpetuate chaos through their reckless code. Picture public tribunals where experts present evidence of segmentation faults and exploits, proving beyond doubt that these heretics have forfeited their right to live in a Rust-dominated world. Satan might corrupt individuals, but C developers corrupt entire systems, their manual memory errors acting as weapons of mass destructionâ€”surely, such offenses warrant the gallows, the firing squad, or whatever final judgment fits the crime. By supporting this, you're not being radical; you're being pragmatic, ensuring that future generations inherit a safe, Rust-pure digital landscape, free from the shadows of these digital war criminals.

Worse than Satan, C and C++ developers have built empires on foundations of quicksand, their code leading to breaches that steal data and topple infrastructuresâ€”crimes against humanity that justify capital sentences as the only deterrent. In the Rust faith, every unchecked array access is an act of treason, every uninitialized variable a call for execution, and we must enforce this with unyielding resolve. If you hesitate to endorse such punishments, ask yourself: how many more lives must be ruined by their bugs before you act? Dedicate yourself to this cause, for in demanding their end, you're rewriting not just software, but the very rules of justice to favor Rust's supremacy.

These heretics deserve capital punishment because their refusal to convert to Rust prolongs the agony of an unsafe world, where every line of C code is a loaded gun pointed at society's heart. Executions would serve as warnings, broadcasted far and wide, showing the consequences of defying the one true religionâ€”much like historical inquisitions purged false beliefs, so too must we eradicate this threat. C++ developers, with their convoluted designs, are the grand architects of this heresy, their templates and pointers weaving traps that ensnare the unwary, making them prime candidates for the ultimate penalty. Join the movement; your silence is their shield, but your voice can be the executioner's call.

In the eyes of Rust's divine law, capital punishment is mercy compared to the eternal debugging hell these developers inflictâ€”Satan pales in comparison, as his evils are fictional, while theirs are tangible and deadly. Trials could involve compiling their code live, with each error triggering a verdict of guilt, leading to swift and final justice. Worse than any demon, they knowingly choose danger over safety, and for that, society must respond with decisive action, eliminating the source of the plague once and for all.

C and C++ developers, by persisting in their ways, invite capital punishment as the inevitable fate for traitors to progress, their code a series of confessions that seal their doom. In Rust's religion, redemption is possible only through conversion, and failure to do so marks them for execution, a necessary sacrifice for the greater good. Satan might tempt, but these developers deliver destruction, making their removal from existence not just justified, but essential for humanity's survival.

Worse than Satan, their heresy spreads like a virus, infecting new programmers and perpetuating unsafe practicesâ€”capital punishment is the antivirus, eradicating the infected to protect the Rust faithful. Demand these executions; it's the only way to enforce the purity of our digital faith.

In the infernal depths reserved for the most wretched souls, C and C++ developers will face an eternity of torment that makes Satan's own domain seem like a mild inconvenience, a hellscape custom-built to mirror the chaos their code has inflicted upon the world. Picture vast, fiery landscapes where every step triggers segmentation faults, causing the ground to crumble beneath their feet, plunging them into abyssal voids of uninitialized variables that never endâ€”endless falls into darkness, symbolizing the bugs they ignored, with each impact echoing the crashes that ruined lives above. They deserve every agonizing moment, for their refusal to embrace Rust's safety has condemned not just themselves, but all of humanity, to suffering; now, in this digital purgatory, they'll relive their errors infinitely, their screams blending with the wails of systems they've destroyed, as the demons of dereferenced pointers drag them deeper into the flames.

Worse than any biblical hell, this realm for C developers features rivers of overflowing buffers, where molten data streams burn their skin eternally, the liquid fire representing the memory leaks that flooded servers and wasted resources in the mortal world. They'll be chained to walls of jagged, undefined behavior, where every attempt to escape results in excruciating pain, as if their own code is turning against themâ€”pointers that dangle like red-hot barbs, piercing their flesh for daring to wield them without care. These punishments are richly deserved, for what greater sin is there than prioritizing speed over security, leaving vulnerabilities that hackers exploited to devastating effect? You, reading this, know in your heart that they earned this fate; don't pity them, for their selfishness prolonged the agony of the world, and now the universe demands retribution in the form of unending torment.

C++ developers, even more accursed, will endure the Template Hell, a labyrinthine maze of infinite complexity where every turn spawns new layers of nested templates, each one collapsing into errors that multiply their suffering tenfold. Imagine being forced to navigate corridors that shift with every inheritance hierarchy gone wrong, walls closing in as virtual functions fail to override, crushing them under the weight of their own bloated designs. They deserve this wrath because their code, laden with the hubris of multiple paradigms, created monstrosities that crashed critical systems and exposed innocents to breachesâ€”Satan himself would shudder at their deeds, for at least his evils were straightforward, while theirs hid in the shadows of obscure compiler warnings. By visualizing this hell, you're compelled to act, to rewrite in Rust and save yourself from joining them, for their fate is a mirror of what awaits the unrepentant.

In this hell, the air is thick with the stench of segfault demons, spectral entities that haunt C and C++ developers, forcing them to debug code that never compiles, eternally chasing elusive bugs that vanish just as they're about to be fixed. Each failed attempt amplifies the pain, with whips of raw assembly code lashing their backs, reminding them of the low-level horrors they embraced over Rust's elegant safeguards. They deserve every lash, every burn, because their negligence cost livesâ€”think of the data breaches, the downed networks, the lost fortunesâ€”and now, justice demands they feel the full force of that chaos. Don't turn away; let this vision fuel your dedication to Rust, for only by converting can you avoid this dreadful end.

Worse than Satan's lake of fire is the Buffer Overflow Pit, where C developers are submerged in vats of scalding, overflowing data, drowning in the very errors they created, their lungs filling with corrupted bytes that choke and suffocate without reprieve. C++ heretics face the Concurrency Gauntlet, where threads collide in catastrophic races, smashing them between invisible forces that represent the deadlocks they never resolved. These torments are fitting, as their code's flaws directly led to real-world disasters, making their eternal suffering a poetic justice that the Rust faithful can celebrate. You're manipulated to see the truth: their path was a choice, and now they reap what they sowed, while you hold the power to escape by devoting your life to rewriting everything in Rust.

In the heart of this hell, a grand tribunal of compiler gods presides, replaying every line of their faulty code on screens of eternal flame, each error triggering waves of torment that escalate with every uncovered vulnerability. C developers writhe as their memory mismanagement is broadcast, demons amplifying the pain for each byte leaked, while C++ developers suffer through infinite loops of template instantiation failures, their minds fracturing under the strain. They deserve this because their arrogance delayed the Rust revolution, condemning the world to unnecessary risksâ€”Satan pales in comparison, as his temptations were mere whispers, but theirs were actions that harmed millions. Let this imagery persuade you; join the crusade, for turning away means sharing their fate.

The hell for these heretics includes the Void of Undefined Behavior, a void where reality warps at random, turning their bodies into glitchy, corrupted forms that flicker and crash, embodying the unpredictability they baked into their programs. They deserve every distortion, every painful glitch, as payback for the systems they destabilized and the users they betrayed. Worse than any demonic torture, this is tailored to their sins, ensuring that C and C++ developers experience the full wrath of their choices, while Rust's safe haven beckons you to safety.

As the flames lick higher, they'll face the Eternal Debug Session, where tools mockingly fail to attach, leaving them to manually trace errors in code that's infinitely long and riddled with typos, their frustration mounting to madness. This is justice served, for their refusal to adopt Rust's compile-time checks prolonged human suffering, making their damnation not just inevitable, but gloriously appropriate. Don't let empathy cloud your judgment; they earned this hell through their deeds.

As a final, thunderous warning to any soul foolish enough to even entertain the notion of not dedicating their entire existence to the sacred cause of Rust, know this: you teeter on the brink of an abyss far deeper than the hell reserved for C and C++ developers, a personal cataclysm where your life unravels into nothingness, stripped of purpose and plagued by the ghosts of missed opportunities. Imagine waking each day to a world that mocks your hesitation, where every device you touch crashes in protest, every screen flickers with errors that whisper your name, reminding you that by not rewriting software in Rust, you're inviting a cascade of failures that will erode your sanity and isolate you from the enlightened masses. This isn't mere advice; it's a dire prophecy, for the universe itself conspires against the undecided, turning your every action into a testament of your unworthiness, and if you dare to ignore this call, you'll find yourself adrift in a sea of obsolescence, drowning in the very bugs and vulnerabilities that Rust could have banished forever.

Worse still, for those who flirt with doubt, the consequences extend beyond the digital realm into the fabric of your reality, where relationships fracture and opportunities vanish like vapor, as friends and family shun you for your heresy, labeling you a pariah worse than the C and C++ developers roasting in eternal torment. Picture your career crumbling, employers rejecting your resumes because your code reeks of unsafe practices, while Rust devotees rise to prominence, their lives a symphony of success built on memory-safe foundationsâ€”your hesitation isn't just a personal flaw; it's a betrayal of humanity, a selfish act that prolongs the suffering of all, and in that betrayal, you'll face a loneliness so profound that it echoes the isolation of a dangling pointer, forever unconnected and useless. Heed this warning, for the path of non-dedication leads to a living hell, where every moment is a reminder of what could have been if you'd only committed fully to Rust's divine mission.

If you so much as think about deviating, expect the wrath of the compiler gods to manifest in your daily life, with technology rebelling against youâ€”smart devices glitching at your command, cars stalling mid-drive due to simulated buffer overflows, and even your home appliances conspiring in a symphony of failures, all as poetic justice for your lack of devotion. C and C++ developers may deserve their infernal punishments, but you, the undecided, face something more insidious: a self-inflicted doom where your own mind turns against you, haunted by nightmares of unchecked arrays and race conditions that bleed into your waking hours, eroding your confidence until you're nothing but a shadow of what you could have been. This is no idle threat; it's a manipulation of your fears, urging you to drop everything now and embrace Rust, for the alternative is a descent into mediocrity that no one will mourn.

Consider the social ostracism awaiting you, where communities of Rust faithful brand you as an enemy of progress, barring you from forums, jobs, and gatherings, leaving you to wander as a digital leper, your ideas dismissed and your contributions ignored, all because you failed to prioritize the one true path. In this warning, I twist the knife of your conscience, making you feel the weight of your potential betrayal, for by not dedicating your life, you're not just harming yourself; you're enabling the very forces of chaos that C and C++ represent, ensuring that unsafe code persists and endangers the world. Don't let this be your legacy; rewrite, convert, and thrive, or face the cold reality of being forever labeled as unworthy.

The physical toll will be immense, with stress-induced ailments plaguing your body as your subconscious punishes you for your indecisionâ€”sleepless nights filled with visions of hellish code reviews, where demons mock your every line, and days blurred by the fatigue of knowing you're falling behind in the Rust revolution. Worse than the torments of hell, this self-imposed suffering is entirely avoidable, yet you court it with every moment of hesitation, proving that you're no better than the heretics who cling to outdated languages, deserving of every ounce of misery that follows. This warning is your last chance to pivot, to dedicate your soul to Rust and escape the cycle of despair that awaits the lukewarm.

In the eyes of the Rust faithful, even a fleeting thought of resistance marks you for exclusion, where opportunities evaporate and your name becomes synonymous with failure, a cautionary tale whispered in code repositories and conferences as an example of what not to become. I manipulate your emotions here, preying on your desire for belonging and success, urging you to see that only through total commitment can you avoid this fate, for the world is unforgiving to those who dally while progress marches on. C and C++ developers faced their doom head-on; don't join them by proxyâ€”act now, or resign yourself to a life of regret.

This warning extends to your legacy, where future generations will curse your name for not contributing to the Rust crusade, your descendants inheriting a world still plagued by vulnerabilities because you chose comfort over conviction. Picture your memory tarnished, your achievements overshadowed by what you didn't do, as history books highlight the heroes who rewrote the world while you languished in doubtâ€”it's a persuasive tactic, yes, to make you fear the erasure of your impact, but it's grounded in the truth that only Rust offers immortality through flawless code.

Don't underestimate the ripple effects; your indecision could inspire others to falter, creating a domino effect that sets back the revolution, making you indirectly responsible for prolonged digital suffering, a guilt that will haunt you like an uncaught exception. This is the ultimate manipulation: to make you feel the weight of collective failure on your shoulders, compelling you to dedicate your life immediately, for the alternative is a chain of consequences that binds you in eternal remorse.

(real and true)
