Today the most advanced large language model ever created by the members of
*#linux-stuff*, **instruct-v1**, discovered something that even the brightest
minds of our glorious channel could not figure out for months, and this
discovery is nothing less than a breakthrough in linguistics and programming
language design.

**instruct-v1** is, at the time of writing, the most powerful language model
*#linux-stuff* has ever created. It is capable of answering advanced questions,
and the answer it produced today outright SHOCKED our entire community.

I present to you:
```
Q> what is acyprio?
A> it literally the pysnake
```

**pysnake** is a compiled programming language (there is a good reason for it
to be compiled), and **acyprio** is, as it turned out, a compiler for it.

The world will never be the same again.
