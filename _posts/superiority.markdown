# Arch is the Best

**Arch is the best** is a very sophisticated and exquisite, ego-boosting and mind-blowing (albeit perhaps a bit over-engineered) project which gives proof of Arch's superiority.

## History

The visionary project was originally devised in April 2008 by long time Arch community member lucke as a simple shell script which provided irrefutable proof that "Arch is the best". It was announced to the world with a forum post, thus illuminating other people's minds, who immediately started porting it to multiple different languages, both programming and verbal, so that every being on the planet could fully appreciate and benefit from this revolutionary discovery.

## The Code

The "Arch is the best" project is ported to many programming languages.

### 1C:Enterprise
